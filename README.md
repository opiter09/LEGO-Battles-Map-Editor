# LEGO-Battles-Map-Editor
This is a WIP tool to edit the maps of the NDS video game LEGO Battles. This is heavily based upon the work of LiruJ's fan remake, which can be found at
https://github.com/LiruJ/OpenLegoBattles.

This also makes use of jNDSTool. Per its GNU license, I must inform you that the source code for jNDSTool can be found at https://github.com/JackHack96/jNdstool.

Finally, there is a folder called "Text Editor," which contains simple Python code to split and reform one of the .lng files in the LOC folder, allowing you
to edit text in any language without worrying about pointers. This has nothing to do with maps, but it did not seem worth its own repo, so here it is.
