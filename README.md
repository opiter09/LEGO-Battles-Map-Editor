# LEGO-Battles-Map-Editor
This is a WIP tool to edit the maps of the NDS video game LEGO Battles. This is heavily based upon the work of LiruJ's fan remake, which can be found at
https://github.com/LiruJ/OpenLegoBattles.

This also makes use of jNDSTool. Per its GNU license, I must inform you that the source code for jNDSTool can be found at https://github.com/JackHack96/jNdstool.
